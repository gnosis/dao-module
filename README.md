# DAO Module

This module allow to execute transactions that have been approved via a Realitio question for execution. The question asked on Realitio consists of a proposal id (e.g. an ipfs hash) that can be used to provide more information for the transactions to be executed. And of an array of EIP-712 based transaction hashes that represent the transactions that should be executed. 

These two components (`proposalId` and `txHashes`) uniquely identify a question on the module. While it is possible to ask the same question with different Realitio question parameters, it is only possible to execute transactions related to a specific question once.

Once the question on Realitio has confirmed that the transactions should be executed, they are submitted to the immutable executor defined in the module.

### Features
- Submit proposals uniquely identified by a `proposalId` and an array of `txHashes`, to create a Realitio question that validates the execution of the connected transactions.
- Proposals can be marked invalid by the `executor` using `markProposalInvalid` preventing the execution of the transactions related to that proposal
- The Realitio question parameters (`templateId`, `timeout`, `arbitrator`) are set on the module by the executor
- A `minimum bond` can be set that is required to be stacked on a Realitio answer before the transactions can be executed
- A `cooldown` can be specified representing the minimum time that needs to pass after the Realitio question has been answered before the transactions can be executed

### Flow
- Create question on Realitio via the `addProposal` method of this module.
- Question needs to be answered on Realitio with yes (1) to approve it for execution.
- Once the has a result and the `cooldown` period has passed the transaction(s) can be execute via `executeProposal`

### EIP-712 details

[EIP-712](https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md) is used to generate the hashes for the transactions to be executed. The following EIP-712 domain and types are used

#### Domain

```
{
  EIP712Domain: [
    { type: "uint256", name: "chainId" },
    { type: "address", name: "verifyingContract" }
  ]
}
```

#### TransactionType

```
{
  Transaction: [
    { type: "address", name: "to" },
    { type: "uint256", name: "value" },
    { type: "bytes", name: "data" },
    { type: "uint8", name: "operation" },
    { type: "uint256", name: "nonce" }
  ]
}
```

### Example

- `yarn build`
- `yarn hardhat --network rinkeby setup --dao <safe_address> --oracle <realitio_address> --cooldown 60 --timeout 30`
- Enable module (e.g. with transaction builder and abi from `0x34CfAC646f301356fAa8B21e94227e3583Fe3F5F`)
- `yarn hardhat --network rinkeby addProposal --module <module_address> --proposal-file sample_proposal.json`
- Resolve oracle (e.g. answer question on Rinkeby https://reality.eth.link/app/)
- `yarn hardhat --network rinkeby executeProposal --module <module_address> --question <question_id_from_realitio> --proposal-file sample_proposal.json`

### Notes

- Realitio contracts can be found via
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@realitio/realitio-contracts
  - https://github.com/realitio/realitio-contracts/blob/master/truffle/contracts/RealitioERC20.sol

### Audit Notes

#### Consistency
- Check for duplicate tx hashes
- Use tx index as nonce to avoid duplication

#### Gas usage
- When the `questionId` is `0` or `INVALIDATED` oracle.resultFor won't return 1, therefore the requires on the `questionId` could be removed
- When asking submitting a proposal with a `nonce > 0` it is not required to check if the `questionId` has been invalidated as we check if it is the `questionId` with the previous nonce
